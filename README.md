# Postman
01.04.2019 - 10.01.2020

Postman is an endless runner game, where you drive through city, delivering packages, earning coins and trying not to hit any pedestrians. Comes with a variety of different trucks to "drive" and props to "deliver", which you can buy in the shop, achievements and tutorial on the first launch of the game, various boosts to spice up the gameplay and autosaving system.

Controls: swipe left or right to throw a package, tap to honk and scare away the pedestrian.

Made with Unity. Used lots of free assets and Appodeal as an AD aggregator.

First NorthSpot project 


[@policelettuce](https://t.me/policelettuce) - All the coding and technical work (and many sleepless hours)


[@lunxrweb](https://t.me/cheatcodesforhoes) - UI design, props, styling, mobile games market exploration, Play Market stuff

Stable on Unity 2019.1.1f1. 
Newer Unity versions have a problem with unsupported Appodeal (AD network) libraries, nevertheless I wanted to preserve the project as it was when it was finished. Deleted only 4 100MB+ files - Appodeal file and some libraries for building Unity project for Android.

## Tech features
- Endless road generation with random marker and pedestrian spawn
- Boost system with upgrades and pseudo-random spawning
- Achievements
- Shop with trucks and delivery props
- Daily bonus and revival system based on AD watch
- Save system
- Settings button with only the sound option... that doesn't work.
